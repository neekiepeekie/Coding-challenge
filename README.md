Thank you for giving me an opportunity to demonstrate my UI skills. Here is a brief overview of what I have done:

1. I managed completing the setup and running the project locally.
2. I added the compensation property having type 'number' to employee type.
3. I calculated total number of directreports to display it in the employee row/card.
4. I displayed all the records present in our data along with the new calculated value of directreports.
5. Added a little styling to the UI to make it look neat.
This is what it looked like:

![Alt text](screenshot1.png?raw=true "Title")


For the Edit and Delete functionality, I used simple HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery with Bootstrap

The UI looks like this:
![Alt text](screenshot2.png?raw=true "Title")

The edit and delete functionality work in this manner:

On clicking the edit button, this appears to edit/update the employee details:
![Alt text](screenshot3.png?raw=true "Title")

On clicking the delete button, we are first asked for a confirmation:

![Alt text](screenshot4.png?raw=true "Title")

After clicking over yes, a confirmation message is displayed with an updated employee list:

![Alt text](screenshot5.png?raw=true "Title")


PS- I have added an extra feature of adding employee details. :)
All of my code is pushed in my repository.
For edit and delete functionality, I have created a codepen link too: https://codepen.io/neekita-salvankar/full/PoorXeR
